Created this project after the online build analyzer I used was removed. 

I scraped MK8D data from the web using Python and exported dataframes into Excel worksheets. Then created heatmap tables of each build part and created a Build Analyzer where you can select your desired parts to view the buildâ€™s stats and compare against up to 2 other builds.
